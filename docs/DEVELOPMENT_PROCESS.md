# 🌱 Garden App Development Process

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step development process for a garden web application that allows users to:

- Authenticate with a simple login/signup system.
- Upload plant images to identify them using Google's Gemini API.
- Receive plant care information.
- Create and manage a virtual garden.
- Interact with a chatbot for garden advice and recommendations.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React) TYPESCRIPT using app router
- **Backend**: Supabase (Authentication + Database)
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API

---

## 📌 Step-by-Step Development

### 1. 🔐 Authentication System

- Set up Supabase and configure email/password authentication.
- Create login and signup pages.
- Minimalist design:
  - **Login page**: basic layout with input for email/password and a sign-up link.
  - **Signup page**: input fields for new user registration.
- After authentication, redirect to the dashboard.

---

### 2. 🎨 Webpage Layout & Settings

- Create main layout for logged-in users:
  - Navigation Header with links: **Dashboard**, **Settings**, **Chat**.
- Pages:
  - **Dashboard**: Main plant identification and garden interface.
  - **Settings**: Profile and account management (placeholder initially).
  - **Chat**: Chat interface with Gemini API.

---

### 3. 🔧 Backend & Gemini API Integration

- Set up Supabase database:
  - Tables for `users`, `plants`, `gardens`, `care_schedules`.
- Configure backend endpoints or serverless functions to:
  - Handle image uploads.
  - Call the Google Gemini API for plant identification.
  - Store API responses in Supabase.

---

### 4. 📸 Image Upload & Plant Information Display

- On **Dashboard**:
  - Add file upload area on the right side.
  - On image upload:
    - Send to Gemini API for identification.
    - Display a simplistic plant card with:
      - Plant name
      - Basic description
      - Auto-generated care schedule
  - Options:
    - **Trash it**
    - **Add to Garden**

---

### 5. 🌼 Garden Creation & Care Scheduling

- When a plant is added:
  - Store it in the user’s garden table in Supabase.
  - Gemini API generates an **optimal care schedule** (watering, sunlight, etc.).
- Display user’s garden as a list/grid of plant cards with care tips and next steps.

---

### 6. 💬 AI Chatbot Integration

- On **Chat** page:
  - Add a chatbot interface.
  - Integrate with Gemini API to allow users to:
    - Ask questions about plant care.
    - Request garden recommendations.
    - Learn more about plants in their garden.
- Maintain conversation history for the session.

## 🧭 User Flow Summary

1. **Login Page**:
   - Simple and dry interface.
   - Sign-up link for new users.

2. **After Login**:
   - **Navigation Header**: Dashboard | Settings | Chat
